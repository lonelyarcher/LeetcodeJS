/* Given an integer array, adjust each integers so that the difference of every adjacent integers are not greater than a given number target.
If the array before adjustment is A, the array after adjustment is B, you should minimize the sum of |A[i]-B[i]|
Notice
You can assume each number in the array is a positive integer and not greater than 100.
Example
Given [1,4,2,3] and target = 1, one of the solutions is [2,3,2,3], the adjustment cost is 2 and it's minimal.
Return 2. */
